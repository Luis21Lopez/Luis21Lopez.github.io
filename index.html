                    <p>
                       Hi, my name is Luis E. Lopez and I am currently enrolled at the University of Houston. I am majoring in Computer Engineering while also proactively learning Web Development on my own. I have strengthened my time management skills over the years, as I manage my school work, a part-time job, and other interests.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        In school, I am part of the Marketing Committee for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I enjoy this position as it allows me to engage my creative side when producing digital media to promote events. Also, thanks to SHPE I became involved with to the organization Habitat for Humanity. Together, SHPE members and I along with a church group, assisted Habitat for Humanity in building a house for a family in need.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        My work experience as a technology sales specialist has taught me how to present computer systems and services to non-technical customers. I can meet customer needs and maintain long-term relationships allowing me to further increase my sales. I now work as a Lab Technician in Dr. Ostrowski's Laboratory where self-motivation is key. Much of my tasks are carried out independently with minimal supervision.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I also offer technical services that rely on my knowledge of coding languages. For Z&#38;E Services, I worked on developing and implementing a web application solution to help tutors track over 65 students. Next, I will be helping the Graduate College of Social Work at the University of Houston update their website.
                    </p>
